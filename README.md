# EZ Wheel
Because I didn't like any that were out there, I made another!  
Big wedges aren't dramatic, gotta have little wedges.  

## MVP Features
âœ… Multiple wedges automatically created based on weights.  
âœ… Duplicate wedges distributed amongst each other with minimal clumping.  
âœ… Labels remembered between visits.  
âœ… Unique colors for each wedge group.  

### Extended Features
âœ… Automatic upscaling when total weights are low. (minimum wedge density)  
âœ… No adjacent duplicates (for most cases).  
ðŸ”˜ No adjacent duplicates (at all! (except when not enough others)).  
ðŸ”˜ Wheel scaling with viewport.  
ðŸ”˜ Mobile friendly.  
âœ… Customizable wedge colors.  
âœ… Built in theme options.  
ðŸ”˜ Fully custom theme slot.  
âœ… Settings (duration/toggle/speed/etc).

## Things I learned
- Implementing memo to prevent the wheel from re-rendering while animating.
- Implementing useContext to pass things throughout a large component tree when State passing by props becomes unwieldy.
- Tying useMemo into the context as well since subscribing to the context within the wheel made its own useMemo not work.
- Linking Stateful Context to Local Storage.
- SVG path drawing.
- Canvas drawing.  
- Generating elements within functions and returning them to a parent they depend on (SVG paths).  
- Conditionally rendered elements are (sometimes?) still "alive" even if behind a `<falsy> &&`.
- CSS keyframe animations.
- Getting the coordinates of user interaction.
